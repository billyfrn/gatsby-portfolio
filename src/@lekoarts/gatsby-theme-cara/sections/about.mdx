## About me

> Although I am a front end developer by title, 
> I have so much more to offer!

I receive my BS in Graphic Information Technology at Arizona State University with my focus in commercial photography and web development. I started off at a local marketing company in Phoenix creating Wordpress marketing sites for small businesses at this stage I would have considered myself a graphic designer/web designer in that I created logos, branding, and websites using custom Wordpress themes and the Adobe suite for all graphic design work (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and XD).

From there, I moved to an agency in Scottsdale where I blossomed into the front-end developer I am today. Working on custom websites, landing pages, forms, and even a VR tour with a team of backend developers and graphic designers. Through my experience at the agency I've been able to develop with CMS like Hubspot, Salesforce, Shopify, Wordpress, Squarespace, and Expression Engine.

In addition to development work at the agency, I have freelance clients that I have created custom Wordpress sites. When I'm not whipping up code, I also shoot photo and video professionally with my wife (predominantly weddings and elopements).
