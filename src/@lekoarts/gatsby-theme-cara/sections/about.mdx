## About me

> Although I am a front end developer by title, I have so much more to offer.

I receive my BS in Graphic Information Techonology at Arizona State University with my focus in commercial photography and web development. I started off at a local marketing company in Phoenix creating Wordpress marketing sites for small businesses at this stage I would have considered myself a graphic designer/web designer in that I created logos, branding, and websites using custom Wordpress themes. 

From there, I moved to an agency in Scottsdale where I blossomed into the front-end developer I am today. Working on custom websites, landing pages, forms, and even a VR tour. Through my experience I've been able to develop with CMS like Hubspot, Salesforce, Shopify, Wordpress and Expression Engine.
